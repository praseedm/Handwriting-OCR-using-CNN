# Handwriting-OCR-using-Deeplearning
Build and hosted a web app which takes user input in live handwritten characters and predicts character using pre trained CNN Model.
A web application is deployed with this model in back-end using Flask framework.

### Convolutional Neural Network
A Deeplearning model for Handwritten character recognition using Convolutional Neural Network Architecture is trainned on EMNIST dataset.
